        <p>At Shiny Windows, I like to keep it simple, take my time to be careful inside your home and be picky about the details. The following are my areas of focus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Window Cleaning</li>
            <li>Gutter Cleaning</li>
            <li>Pressure Washing</li>
            <li>Screen Repair</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Shiny Windows is owned by a solo operator, I am able to clean 90% of homes with the newest water-fed pole technology; enabling me to reach up to 40 feet in the air with spot-free results. However, if a job seems too dangerous or technical to do alone, I will happily refer you to a specialist.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi, Oregon!<br>I'm Brian.</p>
      <p> I moved out to the Pacific Northwest from Montana in February of 2019. I have been cleaning windows since 2005 and have owned my own business with a few employees since 2006.</p>
      <p> I am experienced in Residential, Storefront and Commerical work. I have done some construction clean-up and know which tools and chemicals to use and when to use them. I'm eager to gain new customers in the Portland Metro area.</p>
