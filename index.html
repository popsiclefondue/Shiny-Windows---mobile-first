        <h2><b>Pricing</b></h2>
        <p>Pricing is simple with Shiny Windows. So simple, you can do it yourself.<br><br><b>We simply charge $5 per unit.</b><br><br>Need one window pane cleaned? Five bucks.<br><br>Need a screen cleaned? Five Bucks.<br><br>A simple single-hung sliding window with two panes and a screen to clean from the outside only would be fifteen bucks. Want that same window cleaned on the inside? There are two extra panes to clean, so add ten bucks.<br><br>So... a single window, perfectly cleaned, scrubbed, wiped down and detailed could cost $25 bucks.<br><br>Are you unsure of your math or too busy? Maybe you want me to take apart the sliders and clean the tracks? Perhaps you have a lot of french-panes or divided light windows, or maybe your windows are unusually large, old or WAAAAAY up there? I'm happy to come out to your place and count them up myself to give you a more accurate estimate.</p>

        <h2><b>About</b></h2>
        <p>Shiny Windows is owned by me! Brian.<br><br>I moved out to Portland in 2019 for the weather and the views and the easy access to the outdoors. I'm an art enthusiast who wanted to be closer to a larger art community.<br><br>After fifteen years in business, I have decided to stop working on roofs and gutters. Although I have poles and ladders to clean the highest windows most homes have, I seek to minimize walks on roofs. Perhaps you already have a roofer, handyman, landscaper, pressure-washer, etc. that you like because they're good at what they do. I'd like to be your window cleaner, so please give me a call if you think we'd be a good fit!</p>
